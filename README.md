## Accounts Needed

In order to interact with code examples, accounts for the following two online services will be needed:

- Google
  - We'll be using Google accounts to run code examples in [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - If you don't already have a Google Account, you can create one for free at [https://accounts.google.com/signup](https://accounts.google.com/signup) 

- SAS OnDemand for Academics (ODA)
  - We'll be accessing ODA accounts from Google Colab, which will require you to know the Region associated with your ODA account. (The Region for an ODA account is typically displayed in the upper-right corner after logging in.)
  - If you don't already have an ODA account, you can create one for free at [https://welcome.oda.sas.com/](https://welcome.oda.sas.com/)
  - Note: To create an ODA account, you will also need a SAS Profile account. If you don't already have a SAS Profile account, you can create one for free using the "Don't have a SAS Profile?" link on the ODA login page.
